        This adaptive assessment evaluates <strong>the depth of knowledge for each individual concept</strong> by adjusting question difficulty immediately after each response. Each cycle starts with a <strong>hard question</strong> targeting higher‑order thinking skills such as <em>create</em> or <em>evaluate</em>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Correct</strong> → move to another hard question on the next concept</li>
        <li><strong>Incorrect</strong> → progress to a medium‑difficulty question on the same concept, designed to assess skills like <em>analyze</em> or <em>apply</em></li>
        <li><strong>Incorrect on medium</strong> → move to an easy question on the same concept, checking <em>understanding</em> or <em>remembering</em>, before starting the next cycle at hard</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This approach allows the quiz to pinpoint <strong>not just if a learner knows a concept</strong>, but <strong>at what cognitive depth</strong> they can demonstrate mastery — making it especially useful for skill‑based or performance‑based assessments.
      </p>
      <p>
        The design aligns with <strong>Bloom’s Taxonomy</strong> and principles of <strong>formative assessment</strong>, ensuring that each learner’s experience is tailored to their demonstrated mastery level for each concept. This targeted adaptation reduces frustration for learners who need foundational support while challenging those ready for advanced thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
        Built in <strong>Articulate Storyline 360</strong>, this project demonstrates:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Question‑by‑question branching logic using triggers and conditional variables</li>
        <li>Targeted difficulty scaling per concept based on Bloom’s cognitive levels</li>
        <li>State‑based control to ensure each question is only counted once</li>
        <li>Variable tracking for total correct answers, correct answers per cycle, and performance by difficulty level</li>
        <li>Consistent slide templates for rapid question development</li>
        <li>Chromeless player setup for distraction‑free assessment delivery</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This model works well for scenarios where <strong>evaluating mastery depth per concept</strong> is important, such as skills assessments, competency testing, and targeted review activities.
