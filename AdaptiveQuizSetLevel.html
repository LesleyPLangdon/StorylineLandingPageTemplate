        This interactive learning experience invites users to explore five world‑famous landmarks — from the Eiffel Tower to the Pyramids of Giza — through a clickable, visually engaging map interface. Each landmark opens a pop‑up layer featuring an image, a concise historical description, and an engaging “fun fact” to spark curiosity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The design draws on <strong>Mayer’s Multimedia Learning Principles</strong> by pairing concise on‑screen text with relevant imagery to reduce cognitive load and increase retention. The interactive map format also supports <strong>constructivist learning</strong>, allowing learners to explore content in a self‑directed, non‑linear path.
      </p>
      <p>
        Built in <strong>Articulate Storyline 360</strong>, this project demonstrates:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Custom navigation with clickable hotspots and <strong>visited state</strong> feedback</li>
        <li>Multi‑layer slide design with consistent <strong>template‑driven layout</strong></li>
        <li>Light visual animation for smooth transitions</li>
        <li>Integration of high‑quality, royalty‑free imagery and vector icons</li>
        <li>Variable‑based tracking of visited locations (optional in expanded versions)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This project can stand alone as a microlearning activity or be embedded as an interactive element within a larger eLearning course.
