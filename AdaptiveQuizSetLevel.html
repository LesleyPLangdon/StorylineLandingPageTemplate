        This adaptive assessment evaluates learner performance in <strong>sets of three questions</strong> and adjusts the difficulty level for the next set based on results. Learners begin with three moderate‑difficulty questions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>3 correct</strong> → move to a set of three hard questions</li>
        <li><strong>2 correct</strong> → continue with moderate questions</li>
        <li><strong>0–1 correct</strong> → move to three easy questions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        After each set, performance is re‑evaluated, ensuring that learners work at a difficulty level that is appropriately challenging while avoiding unnecessary frustration.
      </p>
      <p>
        The design supports <strong>mastery learning</strong> by providing a tailored challenge path and draws on principles from <strong>Bloom’s Mastery Learning Theory</strong> and <strong>Vygotsky’s Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)</strong>. Grouping questions by difficulty level in short, consistent cycles also leverages <strong>chunking</strong> to help learners focus on performance within manageable segments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Built in <strong>Articulate Storyline 360</strong>, this project demonstrates:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Conditional branching logic using variables and triggers</li>
        <li>Difficulty‑based question grouping and navigation control</li>
        <li>Variable tracking of total correct answers, correct answers per set, and performance by difficulty level</li>
        <li>Slide templates for rapid question development</li>
        <li>Clear, minimal player navigation for focused assessment delivery</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This model works well as a standalone assessment or as part of a larger course, providing targeted difficulty adjustment at logical checkpoints.
